I'm Zibblobet, I just kinda chill and make whatever I feel like

My favorite language is C++ but I use a lot of C-style code because C++ is in the midst of an identity crisis
I'm an archer hobbyist and my favorite bow is the recurve
I also enjoy learning about history and the era I like to study the most is (basically) the whole of the medieval period
